## Try it now

Try the GPT-4 powered PR-Insight instantly on _your public GitHub repository_. Just mention `@KhulnaSoft` and add the desired command in any PR comment. The insight will generate a response based on your command.
For example, add a comment to any pull request with the following text:
```
@KhulnaSoft /review
```
and the insight will respond with a review of your PR


To set up your own PR-Insight, see the [Installation](https://khulnasoft.github.io/pr-insight/installation/) section below.
Note that when you set your own PR-Insight or use KhulnaSoft hosted PR-Insight, there is no need to mention `@KhulnaSoft ...`. Instead, directly start with the command, e.g., `/ask ...`.

## Web Interface

PR-Insight now includes a modern web interface built with Next.js and hosted on Vercel. The web interface provides:

- **Dashboard**: Overview of PR analysis activity and performance metrics
- **Tool Interface**: User-friendly interface for all PR analysis tools
- **Real-time Updates**: Live status tracking for analysis jobs
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop and mobile devices

### Running the Web Interface Locally

1. Navigate to the web directory:
   ```bash
   cd web
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Deployment to Vercel

The web interface is automatically deployed to Vercel when changes are pushed to the main branch. The deployment process:

1. Builds the Next.js application
2. Configures API proxy to the FastAPI backend
3. Deploys to Vercel's global CDN
4. Sets up SSL certificates automatically

### Configuration

The web interface connects to the FastAPI backend through the `/api` proxy route. Update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` environment variable in Vercel to point to your deployed backend instance.

## Why use PR-Insight?

A reasonable question that can be asked is: `"Why use PR-Insight? What makes it stand out from existing tools?"`

Here are some advantages of PR-Insight:

- We emphasize **real-life practical usage**. Each tool (review, improve, ask, ...) has a single GPT-4 call, no more. We feel that this is critical for realistic team usage - obtaining an answer quickly (~30 seconds) and affordably.
- Our [PR Compression strategy](https://khulnasoft.github.io/pr-insight/core-abilities/#pr-compression-strategy)  is a core ability that enables to effectively tackle both short and long PRs.
- Our JSON prompting strategy enables to have **modular, customizable tools**. For example, the '/review' tool categories can be controlled via the [configuration](pr_insight/settings/configuration.toml) file. Adding additional categories is easy and accessible.
- We support **multiple git providers** (GitHub, Gitlab, Bitbucket), **multiple ways** to use the tool (CLI, GitHub Insight, GitHub App, Docker, ...), and **multiple models** (GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Anthropic, Cohere, Llama2).


## Data privacy

### Self-hosted PR-Insight

- If you host PR-Insight with your OpenAI API key, it is between you and OpenAI. You can read their API data privacy policy here:
https://openai.com/enterprise-privacy

### KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Insight Pro 💎

- When using PR-Insight Pro 💎, hosted by KhulnaSoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, KhulnaSoft-hosted PR-Insight Pro will use KhulnaSoft’s proprietary models — if this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requests’ data — PR-Insight will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.

### PR-Insight Chrome extension

- The [PR-Insight Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-insight-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) serves solely to modify the visual appearance of a GitHub PR screen. It does not transmit any user's repo or pull request code. Code is only sent for processing when a user submits a GitHub comment that activates a PR-Insight tool, in accordance with the standard privacy policy of PR-Insight.
