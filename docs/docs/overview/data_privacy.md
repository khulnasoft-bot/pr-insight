## Self-hosted PR-Insight

- If you self-host PR-Insight with your OpenAI (or other LLM provider) API key, it is between you and the provider. We don't send your code data to Khulnasoftservers.

## Pr Merge ðŸ’Ž

- When using Pr MergeðŸ’Ž, hosted by Khulnasoft, we will not store any of your data, nor will we use it for training. You will also benefit from an OpenAI account with zero data retention.

- For certain clients, Pr Merge will use Khulnasoftâ€™s proprietary models. If this is the case, you will be notified.

- No passive collection of Code and Pull Requestsâ€™ data â€” Pr Merge will be active only when you invoke it, and it will then extract and analyze only data relevant to the executed command and queried pull request.


## Pr Merge Chrome extension

- The [Pr Merge Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/pr-insight-chrome-extension/ephlnjeghhogofkifjloamocljapahnl) will not send your code to any external servers.
